      <p>
        I am Xiao Yang, a designer with a background in architecture and
        computer science. I enjoy creating data-driven, AI-augmented design
        systems that connect form, environment, and technology.

      <p>
        Tools I use include Rhino, Revit, Next.js, Python, and AWS. My projects
        combine visualization, logic, and sustainable building design.
